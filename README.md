# Unearthed Aiircana - The Red Mage

Hi to everyone who might read this! This is a small repo containing a JSON file transcription of u/aiir_'s Red Mage Homebrew class for Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition. For any who are unaware, this file is meant to be used on the website 5e.tools, which contains many tools and reference tables for use when playing the game. In order to load this into the website, simply go to Utilities > Homebrew Manager and upload the JSON file. The file will be stored in your local browser cache, so if you clear it for any reason you'll need to reload the file again!

The file contains all information for the class, including it's subclasses and a spell list. All spells that involve the class's Balance Die feature have been edited as well - copies of relevant spells have been created that denote them as 'B' or 'W' spells in order to make play smoother for Players and DM's. This'll makes sense once you read the class features. :) 

In order to see the Class details, please go to Player > Classes after loading the file. Subclasses will need to be selected above the Class Features information. To see the class spell list, go to References > Spells and unsure that "Unearthed Aiircana: Red Mage" and "Red Mage (FFRM)" are highlighted in blue in the filter.

This file may be edited as any changes are made to the class, but as I'm not the creator they will lag behind. To see the most up to date version, as well as download a full PDF with some great art and design, please go to the GM Binder link: https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MdUM09F9zodw4FFpoJR 

Hope you enjoy the class!
